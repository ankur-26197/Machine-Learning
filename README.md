# Machine-Learning
The repository contains several machine learning assignments to develop understanding of different topics in ML. These are majorly implemented from scratch to help in
appreciating the concepts and enhance laearning. In each assignment, the problem statements along with prerequisites are defined in either the jupyter notebooks (before attempting
any problem) in a detailed manner or a separate pdf is provided defining these problem statements. These assignments will be useful for anyone eager to learn ML in a broad way.
